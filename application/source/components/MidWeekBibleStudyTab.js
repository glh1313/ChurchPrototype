            "This book is not a traditional commentary. It does not attempt a full-scale exegesis, nor does it provide explanations of some of the subtle arguments in the Johannine Letters that bind the text together. Rather, it is an exposition of John's Letters -- demonstrated, for example, in the way most of the outlines are cast in the second person, often in the imperative, like points in many sermons. The author takes pains to connect the dominant themes of each section of the biblical text with central Christian truths. Each chapter ends with an extensive \"Reflect and Discuss\" section -- one of the strongest features of the book.",
            "Daniel L. Akin is the president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, North Carolina. He holds a Ph.D. in Humanities from the University of Texas at Arlington and is the author or editor of numerous books and Bible commentaries including Theology for the Church and the New American Commentary on 1, 2, and 3 John."
